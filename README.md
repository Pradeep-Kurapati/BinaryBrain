# Binarybrain

BinaryBrain is a blogging platform developed as a project to showcase my skills. It utilizes Django for the backend and Bootstrap for the frontend. The platform allows users to read blogs written by me in the 'Blog' section. The home page features an aesthetically pleasing layout with a Bootstrap carousel, a navigation bar, and many more!
